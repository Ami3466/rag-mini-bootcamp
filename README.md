# RAG Mini Bootcamp
In this pilot course, you'll build a Naive RAG-based question-answer agent that supports the following HTML documents:
- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.10997v5)
- [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/)  

Understanding Naive RAG architecture is the first step towards understanding more advanced architectures and techniques appropriate for production settings.
